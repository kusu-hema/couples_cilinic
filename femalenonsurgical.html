            At Aruna Couples Clinic, our focus is on relationship and sexual health; however, we appreciate the importance of individual well-being and self-care practices. If you're considering a skincare procedure like a senatine peel, it's crucial to consult with qualified dermatologists or skincare professionals who specialize in such treatments.

            Senatine peels, also known as phenol peels, are a type of chemical peel used to address skin concerns such as wrinkles, fine lines, and sun damage. These deep peels require careful consideration due to their intensity. The procedure involves the application of a chemical solution to the skin, which causes controlled exfoliation.
            
            While our expertise centers on couples' well-being, we encourage individuals to prioritize their overall health, including skincare choices. If you have questions or seek information on senatine peels, we recommend consulting with skincare professionals who can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific needs.
